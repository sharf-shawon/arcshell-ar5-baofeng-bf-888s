# Arcshell AR-5 / BaoFeng BF-888s / Pxton PX-888s Radio Documentation

![Arcshell AR-5 Radio Pair](assets/images/arcshell-ar-5-pair.jpg)

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for beginners and enthusiasts who have purchased Arcshell AR-5 radios. Whether you're seeking detailed information or guidance on usage, this repository aims to simplify the learning process by gathering valuable insights, tips, and resources in one place.

Arcshell AR-5, Pxton PX-888s and some more radios are said to be a rebrand of BAOFENG BF-888S radios. They also seem to have the same/similar circuitry inside, so I added it to the title for better search visibility.

Feel free to contribute any valuable information you have to make this repository more helpful for others.

## Important Information
- **Legal Considerations:** The default channels that come with the radio can clash with federal agencies and can lead to potential legal charges and fines.
- **Licensing:** Apparently [Arcshell AR-5 radios are FCC Part 90 certified](https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2ARTCARAR/5466678), instead of Part 95 for GMRS. So, you will need an Amateur Radio License to legally transmit using these. 
- **Repeater Usage:** If you have a license, you can find "open" access repeaters in your local area to extend the range of your radios. Use of some repeaters may be subject to repeater owner's permission.
- **Repeater Etiquette:** When using a repeater, you must follow the etiquettes.
- 
- ~~**Channel Usage:**You can safely use the radios within FRS channels without a license.~~ Legally, you need a license to transmit using this radio. Regardless of which channel/frequency you are using.  
- ~~**Licensing:** If you are willing to get a license for this radio, a GMRS license costs $35 and covers your entire family.~~ You will need a HAM Radio license. [More About Licensing](#licensing-information)

## User's Manual

If you've misplaced your user's manual, you can find a copy on [FCC Website](https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2ARTCARAR/5466687.pdf). This specific manual is for the Arcshell AR-5, however, Baofeng BF-888s and Pxton PX-888s been tested to have the exact same functions and features - so this manual should be sufficient.

## Factory Default CHIRP Images

The factory default (aka virgin config) CHIRP img files can be found in the [/factory-default-images](/factory-default-images/) directory of this repositories. So far the collection includes the identical three models specified above. Links to the images:

## DIY Programming Cable

To program your Arcshell AR-5 radios, you'll need a programming cable like this one:

![Baofeng USB Programming Cable](assets/images/baofeng-usb-programming-cable.webp)

You can either purchase one for [less than $2 from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805744418678.html) or create your own using a USB to Serial FTDI converter. Here's a diagram for the DIY programming cable:

Following is a photo of my DIY USB Radio Programmer:

![My DIY USB Radio Programmer](assets/images/my-diy-usb-radio-programmer.jpg)

## Programming Software

Once you have a programming cable, you may download [CHIRP](https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Download) to program your radio. For guidance on using CHIRP, refer to this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ_JzivmjyI) from NotaRubicon Productions.

## Use with Walkie Talkies

If you have previously owned other walkie talkies and wish to use them alongside your Arcshell AR-5 radios, you need to ensure compatibility and proper channel settings.

Check the user manual or specifications of your other walkie talkies to verify their frequency bands and supported modes.

***Legal Note:** You still need a license to transmit on FRS frequencies using GMRS radios. Maximum allowed power to transmit on FRS channels without a license is 0.5-2.0W.*

### Usage
This setup is ideal if you intend to distribute radios to your children without concern about them transmitting on frequencies other than FRS. You can provide the walkie talkies to your children while carrying the 'adult radios' yourself.

### Channel Configuration

If your previous Walkie Talkies use FRS channels, you can configure your Arcshell AR-5 radios to use compatible channels. By programming your AR-5 radios to operate on FRS channels, you can effectively communicate with your previous walkie talkies.

Tip: "Channels 15-22, (however,) offer GMRS users the highest power option, so these are preferred for tactical communications." -[CERT-LA](https://www.cert-la.com/downloads/radio/FRS-GMRS-Frequency-Chart.pdf)


### Programming Process

1. Identify the FRS channels used by your walkie talkies. Refer to the user manual or specifications provided with your walkie talkies for this information.

2. Program your Arcshell AR-5 radios to use the same [FRS Channels](#frs-channel-frequencies). Use the programming software and cable mentioned earlier in this documentation to configure the channel settings of your AR-5 radios accordingly.

3. Once programmed, test the communication between your Arcshell AR-5 radios and the walkie talkies.

## Licensing Information
As mentioned above, you legally need a license to transmit using this radio. Regardless of which channel/frequency you are using. To get this license you will need to take a test, which lasts for 10 years. The test itestf is pretty inexpensive (~$35). Apparently, most people are passing the exam with a weeks preparation. There are plenty of websites available for free practise test. AND you can even **take the test online**!

#### Example Setup

Here's an image of where I setup Arcshell AR-5 radios alongside my existing [Walmart brand walkie talkies](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Onn-23-mile-Walkie-Talkie-3-pack-with-Two-Way-Radios-LED-Light-22-FRS-Channel-Options/1027134774):

![My Setup](assets/images/my-setup.jpg)


*I also named my radios for easy tracking and simply for the fun of it. :wink: If you are wondering where these names came from, they are [traditional Bangladeshi iftar items](https://accordingtoathena.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/fullsizerender-26.jpg). :bangladesh:*

[Update: I have also acquired a Baofeng BF-888S and a Pxton PX-888s radios since the last picture was taken. I can confirm the above mentioned tests to work from personal experience.]
